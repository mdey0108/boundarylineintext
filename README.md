this is a readme file 

we have the data sets in "Data_Set/Data_Set" folder  

folder structure

---->Data_Set

----|--->Data_Set

----|--->Images

---->index.html

---->readme.md

---->script.py

run "pip install opencv-python" to install opencv library

to run script use command "python script.py"

script will iterates on "Data_Set/Data_Set" folder  and search for .json file and extract the points and image name from .json file
after applying the baoundary the image will save on "Data_Set/Images" folder  


i tryed to run it in browser by using brython implimentaion shown in index.html 

but the cv2 library will not importing in that brython script 
thats why i'm not able to run the script in browser

one more mathod to run python in web browser is  as a independent webapp through the flask or django framework
